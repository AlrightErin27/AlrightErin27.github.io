## P1: Game Pitch

<p>_Title Ideas_: "Bahhh Humbug" or "Q-tip & The Race to Bed"</p>
<p>_Game Inspiration_</p>
<p>My game is based on the Running Dinosaur Game that can be found in Chrome's extensions.</p>
<p>_Theme_</p>
<p>Instead of a Dinosaur running with abandon through Joshua Tree, my game will be hitting a little closer to home. It will feature a a cute little lamb taken straight from your drowsy subconscious mind.</p>
<p>Q-tip, our curly little friend, is doing his darn best to jump over objects in his way to the end zone where you two can finally get some shuteye!</p>
<p>_Breakdown_</p>
<p>The start screen will include a Start Button, Game Instructions & a Backstory.
Once start has been pushed, a timer will begin in the top right corner of the screen and you have control of <p>Q-tip. He only jumps, and that can be done by pressing the space-bar.</p>
The background image will stay fixed, yet small objects bushes and fences start panning towards you creating the illusion that you are running forwards. You must clear the objects for 1 minute to make it to the end and win the game.</p>
<p>If you win, there will be a pillow for you to lay your fluffy little lamb head down to sleep. If you don't make it over an object and lose a screen will pop up over your game that complains you you've lost and has an image of tired eyes. The loser screen also offers you a reset button.</p>
<p>An additional event I'd like to add to the game, if I have time, is to "catch some Z's." Meaning, little z's will float just in reach as you jump. If you get one it knocks 10 seconds off your time.</p>
