### P1-Sleep-Game

<center><h1> Q-tip & the Race to Bed! </h1></center>

<center><h3> Overview </h3></center>
<p>Game Inspiration</p>
<p>My game is based on the Running Dinosaur Game that can be found in Chrome's extensions.</p>
<p>Theme</p>
<p>Instead of a Dinosaur running with abandon through Joshua Tree, my game will be hitting a little closer to home. It will feature a a cute little lamb taken straight from your drowsy subconscious mind.</p>
<p>Q-tip, our curly little friend, is doing his darn best to jump over objects in his way to the end zone where you two can finally get some shuteye!</p>

<center><h3> Rules </h3></center>
<p>Breakdown</p>
<p>The start screen will include a Start Button, Game Instructions & a Backstory.
Once start has been pushed, a timer will begin in the bottom right corner of the screen and you have control of Q-tip. He only jumps, and that can be done by pressing the space-bar.</p>
The background image will stay fixed, yet small objects bushes and fences start panning towards you creating the illusion that you are running forwards. You must clear the objects for 1 minute to make it to the end and win the game.</p>
<p>If you win, there will be a pillow for you to lay your fluffy little lamb head down to sleep. If you don't make it over an object and lose a screen will pop up over your game that complains you you've lost and has an image of tired eyes. The loser screen also offers you a reset button.</p>
